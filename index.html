        <h2>Baahubali: The Beginning (2015)</h2>
        <div class="story-section">
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>The first part, *Baahubali: The Beginning*, introduces the kingdom of Mahishmati and centers on two main characters:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shivudu (Baahubali):</strong> A strong and courageous young man who grows up in a remote village and is unaware of his royal lineage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bhallaladeva:</strong> A ruthless prince, and the son of the king, Bijjaladeva.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Shivudu, while living in the village, becomes curious about the people in the nearby kingdom of Mahishmati. After many adventures, he learns about his real identity as the son of Maharani Sivagami and King Vikramadeva. He is the rightful heir to the throne of Mahishmati.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Bhallaladeva wants to take the throne by any means necessary. He manipulates his way to power, but the true heir, Baahubali (Shivudu's father), is the hero of the kingdom. Shivudu embarks on a journey to defeat Bhallaladeva and reclaim the throne for the good of the people.</p>
                <p>At the end of *Baahubali: The Beginning*, the film ends on a cliffhanger, with Shivudu (Baahubali) learning that his father, Baahubali, was killed under mysterious circumstances, and Shivudu's journey to avenge his father and restore the kingdom is set in motion.</p>

        <h2>Baahubali: The Conclusion (2017)</h2>
        <div class="story-section">
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>The second part, *Baahubali: The Conclusion*, delves into the backstory of the events leading up to the death of Baahubali and the rise of Bhallaladeva.</p>
                <p>Through flashbacks, the film reveals how Baahubali (Amarendra Baahubali) was originally chosen to be the king of Mahishmati. Baahubali was loved by the people for his wisdom, valor, and kindness. However, Bhallaladeva, jealous and ambitious, schemes to take over the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The pivotal moment comes when Bhallaladeva frames Baahubali for a crime he didnâ€™t commit. The conspiracy leads to Baahubali's tragic death, which causes the kingdom to fall under the tyranny of Bhallaladeva.</p>
                <p>As the story progresses, Shivudu (Baahubali's son) returns to Mahishmati, confronts Bhallaladeva, and uncovers the truth about his father's death. In the epic climax, Shivudu, now fully embracing his role as Baahubali, leads the people of Mahishmati in a final battle to overthrow Bhallaladeva and reclaim the throne.</p>
                <p>The film concludes with Shivudu restoring justice to the kingdom, avenging his father's death, and ensuring that the kingdom is led by rightful and benevolent rulers.</p>
